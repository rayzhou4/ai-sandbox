A Beginners Travel Guide to Portugal
Long before Christopher Columbus, Portugal was considered a once-in-a-lifetime adventure to the edge of the world — even among sailors who had already travelled across far-away oceans. And anyone with the desire to explore a land that’s far-far away will quickly fall in love with this real-life fairytale destination.

The food, wine, music, and architecture are all part of the lasting legacy of the world’s finest navigators. Everything from the Bacalhau (dried and salted cod) to the port wine (fortified for long journeys at sea), and the fairytale-like castles that dot the mountain peaks of Sintra are all inspired by the desire to travel beyond the horizon.

If you visit Portugal today you can still see what life at the end of the world would have looked like more than 500 years ago — even longer when you visit archaeological monuments like the Conímbriga Roman Ruins and Castelo dos Mouros built by the Moors in the 8th Century. Sink your toes into the cool sandy beaches of Praia da Madalena in Porto, and watch the endless blue waves of the Atlantic lap against a shoreline that has welcomed Europe's most notable kings, queens, and navigators for centuries.

If it’s your first time vacationing in Portugal, our AMA Travel experts have put together a list of things you must see, food you must eat, and adventures that must be sought out. Think of it like a map to your next adventure!

What’s the weather like in Portugal?
Located along the same longitudinal lines as New York City, Portugal gets the same mild springs, warm autumn weather, and hot summers — without the snowy winters. Summer average temperature is a perfect 24℃ with heat waves that can push it to more than 40℃. The winter temperatures average 3℃ in the north and 10℃ in the south with the temperature rarely going below freezing at night, and it can warm up to 20℃ during the day.

When is the best time of year to visit Portugal?
Peak season is June through September, giving visitors four whole months to explore Portugal. The shoulder season between late-March to June and October is also a good time to visit but the weather does cool off especially in the evenings.

When should I book to get a deal in Portugal?
Book between November and early-March to get the best deals on flights and accommodations. You’ll also avoid the large crowds and long lines at some of the more popular tourist attractions.

What should I eat and drink in Portugal?
Between the ocean to the west and the mountains along the east, much of Portugal’s food and drink culture is a product of their unique geography and world-travelling heritage. The mountains of Serra da Estrela are home to the best cheese makers in the country. Then there are the vineyards that line the steep hills of the Douro Valley where the native red and white grapes are used for making port and vinho verde (green wine). The rugged coastline along the North Atlantic provides an abundance of delicious seafood particularly sardines, octopus, crab, clams, oysters, and shrimp. Every city and town along the coast has their own specialty seafood dish so don’t be afraid to eat like the locals.

No matter where you’re visiting in Portugal you’ll always work up an appetite with all that walking. Best to book where you want to eat in advance of whatever city you're exploring that day. You might even stumble upon a Michelin star restaurant only to be without a reservation — as of 2021 there were 28 restaurants throughout the country with at least one star.

Piri Piri Chicken – Prepared on a spit and roasted on charcoal as its basted in spicy piri piri sauce. It’s made from dried piri piri chili peppers (native to South Africa), garlic, red wine vinegar, and smoked paprika. The sauce was brought to Portugal in the 15th century after settlers living in Mozambique and Angola discovered the African bird's-eye chili had a medium burn and could be blended in sauce that’s sour, sweet, salty, and spicy all at the same time.
Bica – These small cups of espresso are best served with a light breakfast of sliced bread, ham, and cheese. Try the milky coffee version known as galão.
Bacalhau – Portugal’s national dish. No two restaurants will cook this dried and salted cod fish casserole the same way. The origins go back to the 1400s when Portuguese fishing boats would drop baskets off the coast of Newfoundland to haul up an abundance of cod. The fish were then filleted and preserved in piles of salt for the long voyage home.

Ginjinha – A cherry liqueur originally brewed as a medicinal cure-all using ginja berries (similar to the sour cherry). One of the oldest ginja bars is Lisbon’s Ginjinha Espinheira established in 1840. You’ll also find it when walking the narrow streets of Sintra being served out of dark chocolate cups. Saude! (that’s Portuguese for cheers).
Francesinha – This sandwich created in Porto is as rich and savoury as a sandwich can get. Cured ham, fresh sausage, steak, and layers of cheese are then smothered in a spiced tomato and beer sauce. You can opt for an egg on top, but that’s only if you plan to walk a few thousands steps that day — which is surprisingly easy.
Canned and Grilled Sardines – Portugal is home to the world’s best sardines, and the best canning methods. Don’t be surprised if you see canned sardines on a menu board, they are nothing like the sardines back home. When visiting tapas bars watch for fresh sardines grilled to perfection over charcoal — those brave enough can even eat the heads!
Pastéis de nata – Commonly known as the Portuguese egg tart, there is nothing common about these crispy, velvety treats. These exquisite tarts are made with laminated pastry to make them extra flaky. They are then filled with a thick rich and creamy custard that is caramelized on top. You’ll find them at any bakery or grocery store, but the original can only be found at Pastéis de Belém in Lisbon — the line is worth the wait!

Porto
Keep your camera ready! You’d be surprised how easily modern Europe and ancient Europe overlap in cities like Porto. For example, the Ponte de Dona Maria Pia railroad bridge was built by Gustave Eiffel (of Eiffel Tower fame) in 1877, and the Porto Cathedral built around the 12th Century is only a 20-minute walk away. You’ll also want to book port tastings in advance, as most fill up quickly, especially if you’re visiting during peak season. Much of your day will be spent jumping across the Douro River either by foot, by tram, or even by cable car (Teleférico de Gaia) as you visit outdoor markets, gothic churches, and port wine cellars.

Douro Valley Tour: Wine Tasting, Lunch & River Cruise
Tour the vineyards of port wine producer, Quinta da Roêda. The wine tasting will be accompanied by a careful selection of Portuguese cheeses. Then climb aboard a typical wooden boat (Rabelos) for an unforgettable trip through the Douro Valley.

Lisbon (Lisboa)
Each district offers a completely different experience. With a geography similar to San Francisco (the city even has a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge) the steep, rolling hills and narrow cobblestone streets can tire out the most experienced tourist, even those used to travelling on foot. Take advantage of the public escalators and elevators throughout the city (quick tip: look for shortcuts through department stores). You can also save your legs by taking the public trams, particularly the famous vintage yellow tram #28. The red tiled roofs and the white walls of the Alfama district is the oldest neighbourhood in the city. Keep an eye out for stunning blue and white tile art, and keep your ears perked for the best Fado music in Portugal. Don’t forget to plan your lunch and dinner stops in advance to make the most of your day.

Many take the train from Lisbon to Sintra for a quick day trip, but you’ll need to spend the night if you want to visit all of the UNESCO World Heritage sites in the area.

Then take your time exploring all the nooks and crannies of Quinta da Regaleira, a modern castle built in 1910 with four hectares of parkland that include labyrinth-style tunnels, grottos, and an inverted tower (a 27-meter long spirling underground staircase) rumored to be used for initiation rites by Portugal’s occult Freemason and Knights Templar society.

Small group tour to Sintra, Pena Palace, Regaleira, Cabo da Roca and Cascais

Surfing
One of the biggest waves ever surfed in the world was an 800-foot monster just outside of Lisbon. There are great surfing spots all along Portugal’s coast. The northern coast is perfect for beginners who don’t mind a little cold water. The central coast is for serious surfers looking to ride the big waves — just head to the tiny fishing village of Nazaré where the world record was broken. For smaller waves, warmer water, and better beaches, head to Algarve in the south.

Sailing the Nine Islands of Azores and More
Between the nine islands of the Azores, and the Madeira Archipelago with its island chains, it’s easy to spend a few days sailing between them. Angra do Heroísmo is the largest city in the Azores and the entire central zone is a designated UNESCO World Heritage site with plenty of sightseeing opportunities.

Madeira is also known as the island of eternal spring. The capital city of Funchal is closer to Africa than Europe, but the influence of Portugal's architecture can be found on every street corner. There is no shortage of botanical gardens, and crops growing off the edge of steep cliffs in the rich volcanic soil. Those with an adventurous spirit can explore the underground caves beneath the island.

Algarve Province
With so many beautiful beaches, rugged limestone cliffs, and rustic cities that line Portugal’s southern peninsula, it’s almost impossible to narrow down one unique must see experience in Algarve. Make the most out of any beach-centric vacation by spending a few days exploring the area by foot, boat, plane, and even road. Plan to fly into or out of Faro International Airport. Then explore the coast by boat to discover private beaches, grottos, and underground caves all hidden behind towering limestone cliffs. It’s best to rent a car if you want to visit as many beaches along the southern coast as possible. Make a plan to visit Praia da Falésia, rated as one of the best beaches in Europe.
